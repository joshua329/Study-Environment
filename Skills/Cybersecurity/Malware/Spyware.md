# Spyward
Spyware is malicious code downloaded without a userâ€™s authorization which is used to steal sensitive information and relay it to an outside party in a way that harms the original user. If the spyware contained a keylogger, a program that can record what a victim types into their computer, a threat actor could potentially gain access to sensitive information.
