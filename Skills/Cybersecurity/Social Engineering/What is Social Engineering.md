# What is Social Engineering?

Social Engineering is the art of hacking people. For example if someone has a strong and secure password, it's much faster to tick someone to give you it.

Many can mock some for the idea of being ticked into giving a password, however, this is also the reason why social engineering is effective. Taking full effect of the congnitive biases and social norms.

## **Principle 1: Consensus**

Consensus, also known as Social Proof, is when a social engineer convinces victims that others have already trusted them. There are many ways to apply consensus to social engineering.

## **Principle 2: Familiarity**

Familiarity, also known as Trust, refers to a social engineer using charisma and likeability to get a victim to complete a request. Familiarity is often as simple as striking up a friendly conversation with a victim before making a request. It is often even more effective if the social engineer is, or appears to be, part of the victim’s “in-group.”

## **Principle 3: Urgency**

Urgency, also known as Scarcity, refers to a social engineer creating a sense of hurry to put time pressure on a victim. Creating a sense of urgency discourages the victim from thinking critically about the request while also making them feel like they are helping someone in need.


## **Principle 4: Authority**
Authority, or Intimidation, is a high-risk strategy in which a social engineer attempts to intimidate a victim or claim authority over them. While usually more subtle than “Don’t you know who I am,” Intimidation is not a subtle strategy. It has an elevated risk of the victim reporting the incident rather than complying. More practically, Authority can be combined with Consensus to create the illusion that not only is the social engineer already trusted but that they are trusted by someone with authority over the victim.
