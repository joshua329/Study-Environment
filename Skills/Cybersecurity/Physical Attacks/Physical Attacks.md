# Physical Attacks
We usually think of the digital world of computers as being separate from the physical world, but that’s not true anymore. Computers are physical objects, which means they can be vulnerable to physical attacks. These attacks might involve an attacker physically interacting with the computer, or involve other physical devices like smartcards or flash drives.

## (Not so) Smart Card
Smart cards are a popular target for physical hacking. They’re often used for finance or accessing secure areas, and it’s relatively easy to steal information from some types.

One technique you may have heard of is called skimming, where an attacker will use a fake card reader to skim, or copy a card’s data. This is often used for credit cards, but can also be used for other types of smart cards like ID cards. Often, these skimmers are physically attached to legitimate card readers in poorly-monitored areas such as ATMs or gas pumps.

## Malicious USB devices
This malware might be packaged in a form that requires a user to manually run, but some malware is able to automatically and silently execute as soon as the drive is plugged into a computer.

It’s not just storage devices that pose a risk either: There have been documented cases of malicious USB charging cables and charging stations. One example involved a USB charging cable for an electronic cigarette with a small chip loaded with malware hidden inside the connector. When plugged into a computer, it would attempt to install its payload of malware onto the computer, with the user none the wiser.

## Physical Hacking
Having physical access to a computer opens up new options for an attacker. For example, stealing a password from a well-locked-down computer might be hard to do purely digitally. However, if an attacker is able to physically install a keylogging device, the process suddenly becomes much easier.

Unencrypted hard drives can have OS-based protections bypassed by simply removing the drive from a computer, and plugging it into a different computer capable of reading its contents. Specialized digital forensics software exists for this specific purpose, making it much easier to browse through hard drives for computers and phones, and find interesting or unusual files. While much of this software is intended for use by ethical hackers, it is perfectly capable of malicious use in the wrong hands.

Networks aren’t safe from physical attacks either: A network might appear safe behind a firewall, but a hacker who is able to obtain physical access to a network port could connect a microcomputer to the network, and then to cellular data. The microcomputer will then act as a backdoor into the network, allowing the attacker to target computers on that network without having to go through the firewall.
