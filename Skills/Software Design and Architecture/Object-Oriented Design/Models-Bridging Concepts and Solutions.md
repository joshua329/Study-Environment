# Models: Bridging Concepts and Solutions

Conceptual design is to break down into small and small pieces into the object oriented analysis, and the technical design is to building the solution into the object-oriented design. 

The goal in design is to build models, you build entity, control, and boundary objects displayed in a UML diagram. To deal with the complexity we look at the complexity and design into smaller parts. Models must be small, flexible and designable.
