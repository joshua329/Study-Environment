# Competing Qualities and Trade-offs

We need to design software and system that can find trade offs between different competing qualities. Examples are security, time to market, etc. 
As a software architect I need to ensure the quality of the code base with those competing qualities. I'm dealing with performance, scaliability, for these things. Overall, we are balancing many things, but the main thing is quality vs time to market. We always want the greatest software, however, we do not have the time, so we need to start thinking what is good enough.

## Context

When implementing design decisions into the product, that design may work for one problem, however, it can cause other problems in other area's.

In software design it is important to consider many things. For high performance software, it maybe difficult to read. While high maintainable code can also be slower. In all these things, there is the reality of the product within the broader view. I need to understand and go through those factors and ensure that the tradeoffs that I choose are best suited for the application and business context.
