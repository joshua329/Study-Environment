Class, Responsibility, Colaborate (CRC)-CRC cards are used to record, organise, and refine.

<table style="width: auto; border: px #000000 solid">
    <tr style=" border: 2px #000000 solid">
        <h3>Class Name</h3>
        <p>the class name is the name of a component</p>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            <h3>Responsibilities</h3>
            <p>the responsiblities of the component</p>
        </td>
        <td>
            <h3>Collaborators</h3>
            <p>the other components responsible to fulfil the components responsiblities</p>

CRC cards are supposed to be small to force the designer to design the components and the resposibilities more specifically. They are great for showing the components through all the roles and tasks that are carried out. They are cheap and new cards can be made or existing ones can be made and can be expanded more and more to display and design a system and process.

In this design process, we can display all the cards on a table and talk through with a team to talk about and simulate a system. Through this we can make a more improved design and make a more proper design.
