# Data Collection
Most people are aware that data visualisation, machine learning algorithms, and algorithms, and analyses require data. But where does that data come from? Does everyone have access to data for analysis.

## Data Ethics and Privacy
When wee talk about the collection of data, we need to discuss the ethics. Much of the data available to us comes from individuals and would be considered ***personally  identifiable***, meaning we could use it to identity someone. <br/>
Things like addresses, phone numbers, social security numbers, credit card numbers, and medical records. We have the obligation to protect personallyy identifiable information. 

Ethical issues regarding data collection may be divided into the following categories: <br/>
1. **Consent:** Individuals must be informed and give their consent for information to be collected.
2. **Ownership:** Anyone collecting data must be aware that individuals have ownership over their information.
3. **Intention:** Individuals must be informed about what information will be taken, how it will be stored, and how it will be used.
4. **Privacy:** Information about individuals must be kept secure. This is especially important for any and all personally identifiable information.


We collect, process, and analyze data to better understand our world and make more informed decisions. The first step in any data work is to collect the data itself. Data can come from a lot of places, including research, governments, technology, observation, or directly from individuals - the list is endless. 

Data can also be live and ever-changing based on the most up-to-date information. For example, apps and websites can track clicks and time spent on pages across multiple users at the same time without a human actively recording all the data points.


## Data Sources
Many organisations house all kinds of data. Datasets are often kept private or can only be accessed for a fee. this may be done for reasons like protectinng the identity of individuals, keeping valuable information from competitors, or making a profit from data collection.
