# How to Compile Sass
Sass canâ€™t be directly interpreted by your browser, so it must first be converted, or compiled, to CSS before the browser can directly understand it.

Compiling refers to converting code to lower level code so that it can be executed. By compiling SCSS to CSS, it can be interpreted by your browser and the results will appear on a webpage.

for a file main.scss we can compile by typing
```
sass main.scss main.css
```
