### Use questions to guide your review

Consider the following questions as you review each portfolio. If you are using the portfolio comparison template, answer the questions in the template for each portfolio that you chose to review. Then, in the column to the far right, share which portfolio stood out to you in each category and why.

#### First, how does the portfolio establish the designer’s personal brand? What type of first impression do each of these three designers make?

A designer’s personal brand is how their personality, unique skills, and values intersect with their public persona. It’s the first impression a designer makes! A personal brand should clearly demonstrate who the designer is and what makes them and their work interesting.

#### Second, Is the navigation simple and intuitive?

The navigation is the way users get from page to page on a website. Users should be able to reach the homepage from any part of the site. And the navigation should lead them from one project to the next. It should also be easy for users to navigate to a contact page that includes an email address, a copy of a resume, and links to other professional social media accounts.

#### Third, does the portfolio website go beyond the template?

Although a website builder’s pre-designed layouts make it easy to get started, effective designers go a step further. Portfolio designers can customize their websites to align with their brand and the story they want to tell. For example, designers should remove the text that comes pre-loaded in the template, and replace it with their own content. It's also helpful to register their own domain name, so their website’s address doesn’t contain the name of the website builder.

#### Fourth, does the portfolio website include a diversity of projects?

Each portfolio should have 3-5 projects that demonstrate the designer’s skills. Note whether each portfolio contains a diversity of projects.

#### Finally, is the site housing the portfolio responsive?

If you can, access the site on multiple kinds of devices, such as a smartphone and a laptop. If the site is responsive, its on-screen appearance will adjust based on the user’s device. So, whether someone engages with the website on a desktop computer or mobile phone, they will have a positive experience.

### Summarize and reflect on your observations

After reviewing the portfolios, take a moment to reflect on the following questions. If you are using the template, answer these questions in the space at the bottom of the template.

* Was there an element of the portfolios that you would like to learn more about?
* Did you discover any design element that you would like to include on your own portfolio website?

## Key takeaways

Effective UX designers often draw on others’ work for inspiration and emulate others’ work to build their skills and improve their designs. By analyzing other designers’ portfolios, you’ve gained valuable practice and sharpened your ability to recognize the elements of a good portfolio. This will come in handy when you create your own.
