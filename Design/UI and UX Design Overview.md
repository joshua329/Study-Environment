# UI and UX Methologies

## UX Research
User research is the systematic study of target users of a product or interface, to understand their behaviours, needs and motivations. 
Every UX or UI designer is likely conducting some user research, which can occur at every stage of the desgin process.

There is some research that can be done with quantiative methods, such as surveys, analytics, and A/B testing. Other methods can examine why users behave the way that they do in depth, such as interviews, focus groups and ethnography.

When conducting research, we must keep in mind that what people say, what they do, and what they say they do, are entirely different things. Therefore, there is a need to develop strong interpretive and creative skills to get to the core of why people behave the way that they do. It's important in those research methods to have a full understand of a user's behaviour:
1. **Attitudinal method:** the focus on what the users say, through user interviews, surveys, and dirary studies
2. **Behavioural methods:** observer the users behavirous through enthnographic studies, A/B testing, and user testing.

While information can be gathered in many methods described as above. A skilled researcher is able to convey stores and frame their research in digestible ways that are useful and compelling for others within the organistaion.

## the 10 Usability Heuristics
These principles are good for understanding the good interaction design. They help with assessing where a design is excelling and falling short, and also the trade off.

1. **Visibility of system status:** The cdesign should always keep users infored about what is going on through appropriate feedback within a reasonable amount of time.
2. **Consistency and standards:** Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. Follow the platfform and industry conventions.
3. **Flexibility and efficiency of use:** Shortcuts, hidden from novice users, may speed up the interaction for the expert user such that the dersign can cater to both the inexperienced and experienced users. Allowing users to tailor frequent actions.
4. **Help users recognise, diagnose, and recover from errors:** Error messages shoulld be expressed in plain langauge (no error codes), precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a solution.

## Defining "Good" UX
The methodologies described so far are used toensure that teams are aligned and that the needs of users are centred in the process. But what is good user experience?

Above shows the designer and information architect Peter Morville's UX honeycomb framework, which trys to answer this question. 
* **Userful:** fulfils a user's needs
* **Usable:** easy to use and understand
* **Desirable:** visually attractive and succinct
* **Finable:** easy to naviage and find information
* **Accessible:** users with disabilities can use the product
* **Credible:** the product, company, and services are trustworthy
* **Valuable:** delivers business value

## User-Centered Design
User-centered design (UCD), puts the user at the centre of the product development and involves them in the desgin from the beginning. 
UCD is a proccess of feedback during the development process and/or after a launch.

UCD generally involves the following activities:
1. **Understand:** Empathise with the user
2. **Specify:** Hone in on a specific problem to solve
3. **Design:** Brainstorm and develop solutions
4. **Evaluate:** Test the product or prototype to assess success and incorporate feedback.

## Design Thinking
Design thinking's core activities are ideation, insperation and implementation, which occur across the five stages of the prrocess
1. **Empathize:** Understand the user and the landscape.
2. **Define:** the problem and align with business goals and user needs.
3. **Ideate:** Generate a range of ideas for possible solutions, emphasizing creativity.
4. **Prototype:** Explore potential solutions by creating prototypes of the product to gather feedback.
5. **Test:** Test the best solutions developed during prototyping. Prototyping or testing may lead to redefining the problem altogether. As with the other processes we’ve covered, this is an iterative cycle


## The Product Development Life Cycle
The Product Development Life Cycle (PDLC) is a cross-functional, iterative process, usually involving many stakeholders across an organisation.

The PDLC contains 5 stages
1. **Brainstorm:** Starting from a defined problem or pain point, the team brainstorms all possible solutions. Market or user research can help inspire ideas.
2. **Define:** The team aligns on specifications for the product by defining the vision, goals, target users, features, benefits, and success metrics.
3. **Design:** The product is designed from low-fidelity to high-fidelity, starting with sketches and wireframes and moving to prototypes and a completed interface.
4. **Test:** The product or prototype is tested to ensure it works as intended. Testing can range from informal internal testing of low-fidelity prototypes to usability testing of a high-fidelity prototype or final product by external users.
5. **Launch:** The final design is released to the public, but the cycle doesn’t end here. Typically, testing continues even after the product has launched, and the cycle continues.


## The Double Diamond Model

The ***double diamond*** is a broadly applicable process model for a cross-functional, iterative design or innovation process. 


![Double Diamond Model](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/intro-to-ui-and-ux/key-methodologies/double-diamond.svg#thumbnail)

The two-diamond structure of the diagram illustrates two modes of thinking that occur during the strategy and execution stages of the design process. Divergent thinking explores many possible solutions and generates novel ideas. Convergent thinking analyzes, filters, and focuses ideas and leads to decisions.

Within this, there are the four phases of the double diamond process as follows:
1. **Discover (divergent strategy):** Explore the problem and landscape, and learn from users and the market through user interviews, surveys, and other research.
2. **Define (convergent strategy):** Sort and analyze the information gathered during the discovery stage and hone in on the problem we’re trying to solve.
3. **Develop (divergent execution):** Generate a range of ideas for possible solutions through brainstorms, workshops, low fidelity prototypes, and other ideation methods. Test different ideas with users or within the company to see what resonates.
4. **Deliver (convergent execution):** Hone in on, develop, and deliver the solution. Continue evaluating and testing the developed design to ensure it meets user needs.


#### User Interface
UI or user interface refers to how the user interacts with a system. UI design is a design discipline focused on the visual elements of the interface, for example:

1. **Layout:** Where do elements appear on the screen?
2. **Colors:** What palette is used and what emotions do those colors evoke?
3. **Typography:** What typefaces are used and what do they communicate?
4. **Interaction design:** How do elements respond to user interaction?
5. **Brand identity:** How do all of the visual elements come together to represent the brand’s vision?
6. **Responsiveness and usability:** Is the interface easy to use across different devices?
7. **Accessibility and inclusivity:** Does the interface work for everyone?
8. **Front-end development:** What is the code and technical backbone powering the interface?

#### User Experience
User experience (UX) describes the entire experience around a product or service, taking into account the user’s emotional state, the context or environment, and the designed system or artifact.

![User Experience](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/intro-to-ui-and-ux/what-are-ui-ux-design/ux-venn-diagram.svg "User Experience")

It is a human-centered design discipline that addresses the holistic experience of a product, focused on:

1. **User journey:** The entire process surrounding use of a product, from the problem to be solved through the impact of the solution.
2. **User research:** Qualitative and quantitative research to put the user at the center of the design process.
3. **Deliverables** to document the user experience and define the workflows and features of a product or design, such as:
	- **Personas:** Summaries of example and target users, generally based on a composite of user research.
	- **Journey maps:** A timeline of user actions related to accomplishing a particular goal related to a product or design.
	- **Storyboards:** A sequence of panels (often resembling a comic book) depicting a user story chronologically.
	- **Prototypes:** Iterative models, sketches or wireframes of a design used to gather feedback and inform the final design.


A useful mode lfor understanding the terms of UI and UX design and the overlap between them is through the five elements of UX design

![Five Elements of UX Design](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/intro-to-ui-and-ux/key-methodologies/five-elements-of-ux-design.svg)

#### Strategy
What problem is this product intended to solve? This layer, the most abstract of the model, takes into consideration both user needs and business goals.

#### Scope
What is the product that will be created to solve the problem? Within this layer, the team degines functional requirements (what features to build) and content requirements (written and visual information to include).

#### Structure
How is the design organised and how do interactions work? this layer includes information architecture (the structure and organisation ofcontent) and interaction design (the interactive experience of the product).

#### Skeleton
This layer considers the interface design (design of the interface elements), navigation design (how users move through a system), and information design (presenting information to faciliate understanding). A common output at this stage is a set of writeframes.

#### Surface
How does theproduct look and feel to the users. This layer emphasises the visual design, such as what colors and typefaces that are used. This is the part where UI design is front and centre (though it is not exclusive to surface).
