## How do we make a Wireframe
> Through better and more effective user research, we can have a better understanding of:
> 1) user goals and tasks for the application
> 2) User pain points, behaviours, and desires
> 3) Current Workflows used to complete these tasks.

The process of making a wireframe begins with sketching concepts using pen and paper. Sketching allows us to focus on creating a functional, intuitive, and efficient concept. The location of page elements should provide a solution to our design requirements. 
> Valuable information should be in an easy-to-reach place

It is important to annotate when wireframing. Annotations clearly define wireframe elements functionality and descrube how the wireframe meets the requirements. It isn't good to focus in too much details straight lines, spacing, alignmen-which may slow the process down. 
Through many wireframe iterations and the incorporation of feedback, we can focus on more precise and effictive solutions to our requirements. 


## Wireframe Elements
Wireframe's are created using low-fidelity wireframe elements that are used to communicate ideas during the process. The elements act as placeholders for the eventual high-fidelity content. 

For example, for a logo, instead of populating the space with an image of a logo, we can just write in a box "logo". This makes for efficient and effective development, focusing on the establishing of a content layout rather then content design.

## Why Do We Need to Wireframe?
The purpose of Wireframes is to guide developers when the programming begins. The goal is to establish all the content layout prior to the high-fidelity design and development. This is to avoid costly reworking later on.
Wireframes helps us rapidly iterate and produce solutions in a low-risk environment. It is an effective method in creating solutions with mind to time and resources.

Wireframes are one of the first polished deliverables that can accurately portray the final products structure. They are greate resources for designers, developers and stakeholders to understand how the interface is configured and how the wireframe meets our design requirements.


## What is a Wireframe?
A ***Wireframe*** is a low-fidelity representation of a digitial interface. Fidelity is the amount of detail in the medium it was created. Wireframe has low amounts of detail, and looks almost like a pen and paper sketching. High fidelity designs have a high level of design.

Wireframes, do not contain interactive features and all the elements only serve as placeholders, for thing: logos, navigations, search fields, text, buttons, images, and videos. 
For this layer of design, we want to focus on, 
1. The User Needs
2. Stakeholder Goals
3. Technical capabilities

> Note
> wireframes are not like sketches, which are used to create quick concepts and to iterate ideas

The process of creating wireframes starts from a problem or pain point to ensure that product development meets a real user need and that the whole team is aligned around the same goals. Wireframing is the bridge between user research and a proof of concept. User research is incorporated to create purposeful concepts that can move to functional prototypes.


## Information Architecture
Information architecture is the organisatio, prioritisation, and presentation of information within produts, websites, and other software applications. Effective information architecture is important because it allows users to completed tasks with the least effort required. We can visually represent this infroamtion using a ***site map***.

A ***site map*** is a high-level view representing a content hierarchy within a digital interface. As shown below, it contains block interconnected with lines, with each representing pages, and lines representing their relationships to the pages. The navigation through these paths through the pages are called as ***User Workflows***.

A ***User Workflow*** illustrates the path a user takes in completing a task.
