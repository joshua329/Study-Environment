# Who are my Users?

In the field of user experience design, the “user” comes first. A **user** is a person who is trying to solve a problem and is looking for a product or service to help them solve it. The **user experience** is the journey that the user takes with that product or service. As a UX designer, your goal is to keep the user at the center of every decision you make, and to do that, you need to get to know your user.

Most of the initial UX research that you conduct at the beginning of the project will be focused on getting to know the characteristics of your users, their goals, and their pain points. Understanding the user empowers you to design experiences that are helpful or easy to use.

One of the key challenges of getting to know your users is avoiding taking a narrow view of the user, or making assumptions about what users need based on stereotypes. Users who seem to be different from one another might actually have shared wants and needs. Make sure to step back and get a clear picture of *all* your potential users–which often means that you’ll need to specifically plan to address the needs of users who are often overlooked.

To reach as many users as possible, you’ll consider questions such as these as part of your user research approach:

* Do my users have impairments or disabilities to consider–whether temporary, situational, or permanent?
* How familiar are my users with technology?
* How are my users accessing the product or service?
* Where and when are my users accessing the product or service?
* Have I considered all my potential users?

The goal for user research is to get the widest possible selection of potential users to include as research participants. Make sure to consider income level; demographic data such as age, gender, and ethnicity; educational background; and geographic location.

## Do my users have Impairments or disabilities to consider?

You might be surprised to find out that more than 1 billion people around the world have a disability, out of a global population of 7.8 billion. In the U.S., one in four adults identifies as having a disability. The term **accessibility** refers to the design of products, devices, services, or environments for people with disabilities. As a UX designer, it’s important to keep users with disabilities in mind as you design features or new products. Designing for accessibility isn't an obstacle, but a way to get your products to as many users as possible.

Accessibility is about making products accessible to all people, whether they have a disability or not. Think about inclusive product features that increase magnification, like enlarged fonts. Or features that help everyone understand videos, like closed captions.

Throughout the rest of the certificate program, you’ll learn more examples of how features that were initially designed for users with disabilities became universally used by non-disabled people as well. You’ll also learn more about how to effectively apply accessibility principles to your designs.

## Key Goal

Your goal as a UX designer is to solve a user problem by creating a design that makes every user feel like you designed the experience just for them no matter who they are, where they live, how much they earn, what their abilities are, or how highly they're educated. Gaining a comprehensive understanding of your user's context is an important place to start, and you're already on your way.

Throughout the rest of the certificate program, you’ll learn more about the considerations discussed in this reading, dig deeper into user research methodology, and complete some practice activities to learn more about your users.
