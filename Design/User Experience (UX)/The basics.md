# The Basics of User Experience

**User experience:** How a person, the user, feels about interacting with, or experiencing, a product

**Product:** A good, service, or feature

- **Usable:** Must think of all the people who will use the whether they have disabilities or with different experiences to my own
- **Equitable:** it is usable to many different people
- **Enjoyable:** Builds a positive connection with the applicaiton. How to know if they're positively experiencing this, we must do research.
- **Useful:** If someone is lost and has a map app, but if the application doesn't work then it becomes useless.

Why this is important, when they have a positive experience with a product, they tend use it more and the company that made it.
