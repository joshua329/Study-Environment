# User-centered design and assistive technology

As you’ve been learning, user-centered design means trying to solve problems that people commonly experience rather than trying to solve only those problems that you experience personally. You’ve also been learning that good user-centered design incorporates the assistive technology, or AT, that many people use to interact with their devices. AT works in things such as color modification, voice control, switch devices, and screen readers.

While assistive technologies are often created to support people with disabilities, they’re also used by many people who don’t have disabilities or who don’t identify as having disabilities. For example, consider the technology that allows someone to pinch a smartphone screen to expand an image or piece of text. That technology is used both by people who have visual impairments and by people who don’t.

But when exactly do UX designers incorporate assistive technologies into their designs? The answer is straightforward: Effective UX designers consider assistive technology throughout the design process, from understanding users’ experiences, to identifying users’ needs, to designing and testing solutions.

Check out the following examples.

## **Color modification **

First, consider assistive technologies for color modification. A UX designer is creating a job-application form that users can access and complete on their mobile devices. During the early phases of the design process, the designer tries to understand how users might experience the form on a variety of devices. The designer discovers that some users use both light-mode settings and dark-mode settings to comfortably see and use their devices, switching back and forth depending on their surroundings and the application they’re using.

Based on this information, the designer plans to include a “light mode/dark mode” toggle in the application form itself so users can easily select how they want to view the application form. This feature minimizes the risk that certain users will miss key instructions or interactive features, like text-input fields and buttons.

## **Switch devices**

Now consider an example where a team has to redesign a product after forgetting to account for switch devices. (Remember that a switch device is a technology that replaces a keyboard or a mouse. Switch devices enable people to interact with devices without using one or both of those pieces of hardware.)

A UX design team is working on a new website for a local restaurant. The team finishes its first prototype, which allows test users to simulate navigating the live website. One user reports that they can’t use their mouse to navigate the prototype. Keyboard navigation is an answer to that problem: It’s a common switch technology that enables users to navigate websites and apps strictly with their keyboards, so they don’t have to scroll and click with a mouse.

The principles of user-centered design demand that websites support keyboard navigation. And in many places, laws and regulations require the same! This means the design team must return to an earlier phase of its design process and re-work its prototype to support that switch device. The team could have avoided this re-work if it had used the early phases of its process to better understand how its users use switch devices.

## **Voice control**

Now consider voice control technologies, which enable people to interact with products by using their voices rather than mouses, keyboards, or touch screens. For example, a UX designer is creating a vocal user interface, or VUI, for a smart thermostat. The VUI will enable users to interact with the thermostat by speaking.

At the very beginning of their process, the designer researches how users interact with similar voice control technologies: The designer observes people interacting with other smart thermostats to get a sense for how different users express the same commands. With this information, the designer creates a VUI that enables people to use multiple questions or commands to achieve the same tasks, like lowering the temperature or turning the thermostat off and on.

## **Screen readers**

Finally, consider user-centered design and screen readers. Screen readers read the text on a screen. They also read alternative text, or alt text. Alt text is text that describes non-textual elements of a screen, such as images and graphics. Screen readers read alt text aloud so users can understand the screen’s non-textual elements and how they fit with the screen’s textual content.

When designing with screen readers in mind, it’s crucial to consider your users, determine which images they’ll find meaningful (rather than merely decorative), and then create clear alt text to describe those visuals. With clear alt text in place, users can get value out of your product’s images even if they have visual impairments or low-bandwidth connections that make it difficult for images to load.

## **Grow through daily observations**

If you haven’t already, start observing how you use assistive technologies to interact with everyday products. Do you ever turn on closed captions while streaming a movie? Ask a smart speaker to play your favorite song? Or use the tab key to move from one text-input field to another? If so, you’ve used assistive technology. The next time, stop to consider how the designer incorporated that technology into their design process. Over time, these small observations can help you grow into the user-centered designer you want to be!
