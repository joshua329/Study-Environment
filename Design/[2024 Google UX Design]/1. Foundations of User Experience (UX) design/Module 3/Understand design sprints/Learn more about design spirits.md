If you’re looking for a deeper dive into design sprints, here are some resources for you. The Google[ Design Sprint Kit](https://designsprintkit.withgoogle.com/) is an open-source resource for anyone learning about or running design sprints. The website includes[ case studies](https://designsprintkit.withgoogle.com/case-studies) about design sprints that have solved all kinds of challenges,[ templates for decks and activities](https://designsprintkit.withgoogle.com/resources/overview), and more.

In addition, check out this[ article on Medium about the importance of design sprints](https://uxplanet.org/whats-a-design-sprint-and-why-is-it-important-f7b826651e09#:~:text=A%20Design%20Sprint%20is%20a,and%20testing%20ideas%20with%20customers.). Or, to be really inspired, read the book [Sprint](https://www.thesprintbook.com/buy) by the creator of design sprints and former Googler, Jake Knapp. Pay special attention to the chapters “Start at the End,” to get an overview of how to establish long-term goals for a sprint, and “Liftoff,” to motivate you to get started with your first sprint.

## **An entry-level designer’s role**

You might also be curious to learn about an entry-level UX designer’s role in a sprint. We’ve got the inside scoop for you. Check out this post from the INKONIQ BLOG about[ how a design sprint works at Google](https://medium.com/inkoniq-blog/inside-a-design-sprint-workshop-at-google-3950b1654f2) and this article on Medium about what[ one UX designer learned from their very first design sprint](https://uxplanet.org/3-things-i-learned-from-my-first-design-sprint-ed5d2113afad).

## **Design sprints and the design thinking framework**

You may have observed that the design thinking framework and design sprints are both organized into five similar phases, and they both promote collaboration, user-centered design, rapid prototyping, and iterative testing. However, there are some distinct differences.

## **The design thinking framework:**

* Is an overarching framework with five phases: Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype, and Test
* Is an overall philosophy for approaching problem solving
* Spans the entire product development process and is open-ended
* Utilizes many different methods and tools

## **A design sprint is:**

* A time-bound process with five phases: Understand, Ideate, Decide, Prototype, and Test
* A specific implementation plan for solving a specific design challenge
* Strictly timebound from start to finish, typically spread over five full business days
* One method with a defined process

## **Using design sprints to align to the **design thinking** framework **

Design sprints are an efficient and effective way to keep aligned with the overall goals of the design thinking framework. Since a design sprint typically lasts five consecutive days, it compresses the design thinking process into a focused, intense period of ideation, prototyping, and testing.

Below are some examples of how design sprints can be used to accelerate specific design challenges throughout the design thinking framework.

## **Empathize**

During the empathize phase, the design thinking framework focuses on understanding the users and their needs. Design sprints can be deployed in this phase to quickly research user behaviors and preferences, conduct interviews with users, and analyze customer feedback to understand pain points and opportunities for improvement.

## **Define**

Design sprints during the define phase might focus on refining the problem statement, aligning stakeholders, analyzing the user journey, and generating ideas that specifically address the pain points identified in the previous sprint. This focused approach helps lay the groundwork for the following phases of prototyping, testing, and implementation within the design thinking framework.

## **Ideate**

In the ideate phase, design sprints can be employed to rapidly generate and evaluate ideas. The time constraints and structured activities of the design sprint can help teams generate a large volume of ideas within a short timeframe.

## **Prototype**

The prototype phase is where design sprints find their strongest application. Design sprints excel in creating prototypes that can be tested and validated, and the design sprint approach allows teams to quickly translate ideas into a visual or interactive prototype that represents the potential solution.

## **Test**

Design sprints integrate seamlessly into this phase by providing a structure for conducting user testing sessions and collecting feedback on the prototypes developed during the sprint. The insights gained from testing inform further iteration and refinement.

## **Key takeaways**

UX designers play an active role in design sprints by bringing their user-centered perspectives to help sketch, wireframe, prototype, and test during the design process. In the end, this helps to create meaningful and usable experiences for the target audience.

Congratulations on getting the hang of all things design sprints and how they fit into the overall design thinking framework! Use these resources as you continue to explore the phases and purpose of this key part of UX design work.
