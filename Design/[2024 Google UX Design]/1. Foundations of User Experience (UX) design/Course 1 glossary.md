# Course 1 glossary

We’ve covered a lot of terms and definitions in this course. Some of the terms might have been new, or some of them you may have already known. To make it easy to remind yourself what a word means, we created a glossary of terms and definitions that includes all of the terms from each module of the course. Check it out below!
