# The influence of company size and industry

Have you always dreamed of working with a close-knit group at a startup? Or landing a job at your favorite company? Depending on where you end up working, your job as a UX designer could be quite different! In this reading, you’ll explore how UX design roles can vary depending on the company’s size and industry.

## Startups and small businesses

**Startups** are new businesses that want to develop a unique product or service and bring it to market. **Small businesses** are privately owned businesses with few employees. A lot of UX designers are excited to start work at startups or small businesses because they can see the impact of their work more quickly and develop a broader range of skills.

* **Team size: **Close-knit team and able to work directly with upper management.
* **Growth:** Opportunity for growth due to taking on many responsibilities (visual design, interaction design, user research, and more).
* **Creativity:** Usually more creative freedom with fewer guidelines and processes.
* **Impact:** Lots of impact on final products, with few people working on a project.

## Big companies

At a big company, like Google, you’re likely to work in teams on a specific project. Lots of UX designers want to work at big companies with the people who developed some of the most well-known products in the world. UX teams at larger companies tend to be more compartmentalized by specialization, making it easier for you to become an expert in one particular area of UX.

Many agencies tend to work on a broad range of products, so you can explore many kinds of styles and approaches to UX design.

## Advertising agencies

A lot of UX designers work at **advertising agencies,** which are teams of creatives hired by clients to build marketing campaigns.

This is a great option if you’re open to learning some interesting skills outside of a core UX design role.

* **Relevance:** Work may often involve branding and marketing, and might not focus on UX design.

## Freelancers

**Freelancers** are self-employed UX designers who are hired by clients for their independent services. Being a freelancer gives you a lot of freedom, and it’s a great way for new UX designers to gain experience in the field and add work to their portfolio.

## Deciding where to work

Everyone’s goals as a UX designer are different, so think about what’s most important to you when choosing a place to work. Consider questions like:

* Do you enjoy a lot of structure and processes, or do you like to define your own work and schedule?
* Do you value working on a big team, or are you more comfortable working alone?
* Do you want to focus mainly on UX design, or are you interested in broadening your skill set?
