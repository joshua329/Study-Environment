# Most common UX tools

## **Evolution of UX tools**

The field of UX design and the tools used by designers have evolved over the last several years. Initially, UX designers commonly used Adobe Creative Suite tools, such as Photoshop. These tools were used mostly for print and static design. But, as technology and the demands for UX design evolved, so did the need for increased functionality of digital tools. [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/) was released in 2010 and was the first digital-forward design tool built specifically for UX designers. In addition, more tools like [Freehand](https://www.freehandapp.com/) by Miro, released in 2011, and [Zeplin](https://zeplin.io/), released in 2015, came along, offering prototype capabilities and opportunities for easier collaboration.

As organizations have continued to digitally transform and move towards dynamic work environments, UX tools have had to keep pace. The increase in remote workers, along with dynamic work environments, has presented a need for UX designers to find the right-sized toolset to fit their desired output.

Today, the demand for modern, digitally collaborative tools has not subsided. [Figma](https://www.figma.com/about/) and [Adobe XD](https://helpx.adobe.com/support/xd.html) both took center stage in the UX design world when they were released in 2016. Today, Figma holds one of the biggest stakes in the collaborative design and prototyping market. It offers real-time collaboration, Dev Mode for engineers, and in-product prototyping features, in addition to many custom plug-ins for unique design needs. Adobe XD continues to offer a robust solution for UX designers as well, with features such as cloud syncing, for example, for distributed digital teams. These features facilitate a collaborative element, for teams who are not working in face-to-face environments.

## **Going forward**

Most of the modern UX tools used by UX designers have similar functionality, with some unique features and robust online learning libraries. You will likely use more than one design tool throughout your career. However, in this certificate program, the focus will be on Figma. You’ll learn how to use it, and you’ll work on projects you’ll be able to include in your UX design portfolio.

## **Considerations when choosing UX tools **

Don’t worry - you don’t have to choose a UX tool today! But, at some point in the future, as you dive deeper into your UX design career, you’ll want to choose UX tools that work best for you and the specific projects you’re working on. As you gain a better understanding of UX design and the UX design tools, there are a few things you’ll want to consider when selecting a UX tool:

### **Who you are as a designer**

You may end up pursuing a job as a UX designer. Or, you may end up in a role that is a variation of UX design—for example, a visual designer or a motion designer. You learned about various UX design jobs in [Jobs in the field of user experience.](https://www.coursera.org/learn/foundations-user-experience-design/lecture/0yONp/jobs-in-the-field-of-user-experience) Understanding what UX tools work best for you will ultimately be informed by the role you take on and the corresponding responsibilities and job tasks.

### **The design context**

Another consideration for choosing a UX tool will be the design context in which you work. In some cases, the organization may dictate the tool you use simply based on what it already uses. Or, you may have the flexibility to decide on the tool based on the type of project you are working on or the level of collaboration among team members you may need. These are just a few factors that may influence the type of UX tool you choose.

### **Capabilities of the tool**

When you get to the point of choosing a UX tool, you’ll also need to consider the capabilities of the tool. You’ll learn more about these capabilities later in this certificate program. Going forward, you’ll investigate the tool and ask questions such as:

* Does it allow for mobile-responsive design?
  * For example: You may create templates and layouts for various devices. Does the tool account for, and adapt to, different screen sizes?
* Does it allow for prototyping, testing, and reviewing?
  * For example: You’ll eventually want to build a prototype, or sample, of a product. Does the tool allow you to build the prototype? Does it allow you to test how it works? And, can the tool allow other stakeholders or designers to review it and provide feedback directly into the tool?
* Does it allow for team collaboration?
  * For example: You will likely work on a team with several people. Can each team member work in the tool? Can revisions or suggestions be made by other team members?
* Does it allow for a centralized design system?
  * For example: You likely won’t be the only designer on a project. With multiple team members and collaborators, consistency is key. Does the tool allow the team to view and/or copy styles and properties to ensure consistency across the project?

## **UX tools—an overview  **

In this certificate, you’ll focus on Figma. Figma is one of the preeminent UX tools. There are other UX tools, mentioned previously, you can look at for comparison.

### Sketch, Freehand, and Zeplin

* Work well with very large teams that may struggle to adopt new tools
* Paired most commonly with another of these tools
* Do not require WiFi, enabling offline design work
* Do not afford real-time collaboration, prototyping, or design to development collaborative activities

### **Adobe XD**

* Works well with teams that already use Adobe’s Suite
* Rounds out Adobe’s suite of products with one that is entirely built for digital and UX design work
* Syncs to Cloud rather than using actual real-time collaboration and can be used offline

### **Figma**

* Is excellent for most designers and contexts
* Includes FigJam access, a whiteboard for brainstorming, diagramming, and strategizing
* Requires WiFi connection
* Is a digital-first, remote-friendly, all-in-one tool, allowing for easier sharing, designing, collaboration, and reviewing in our ever-changing, more virtual workspace

## **Do your research**

Check out each tool’s website for additional information. As you educate yourself on each tool’s features and benefits, you’ll be able to choose the UX tool that is right for you. But remember: You’ll be introduced to Figma and you’ll learn how to use it throughout this certification course.
