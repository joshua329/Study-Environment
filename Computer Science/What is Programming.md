# What is Programming?

Programming is giving a set of instructions to a computer to execute. if you're ever cooked using a recipe before, you can think of yourself as the computer and the recipe's author as a programmer. The recipe author provides you with a set of instructions which you read and then follow. The more complex the instructions, the more complex the result.

While sometimes used interchangeably, programming and coding actually have different definitions:

- *Programming* is the mental process of thinking up instructions to give to a machine (like a computer)
- *Coding* is the process of transforming those ideas into a written langauge that a computer can understand
