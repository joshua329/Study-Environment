# tCareer progression for project managers

## Introduction

Industries rely on project managers because they believe they alone can successfully deliver complex projects. It is true that only a qualified project manager can envision the various aspects of a project such as who, what, when, where, and how, while the project is still in its initial stages.

In this reading, you will explore the potential progression in a project manager's career within project management, from entry-level positions, through mid-senior level positions, to top management and leadership

## Entry-level positions

**Project coordinator, project controls officer (PCO), and project assistant**

These are the various designations given to someone who assists the project manager in performing administrative tasks in projects, producing and maintaining project documentation, as well as coordinating between various project team members and stakeholders.

For example, the project coordinator helps the project manager track, document, and maintain the project's health in terms of schedule, cost, risks, and deliverables. They keep track of the project team members and their timesheets across the project.

They also have various other duties, such as booking project meetings, sharing reports to internal leadership, keeping track of project invoices, and assisting the project manager with procurement process, while the project managers focus fully on the project planning, project implementation, and delivery.

**Project managers (PM)**

After familiarizing with the project environment, the entry-level project assistants and coordinators may aspire to become project managers in the future. Project managers are responsible and accountable for managing the projects from end to end. Project managers are also responsible for the successful completion of project objectives.

## Mid-senior level positions

**3) Senior project managers:** With increased experience along the career journey, project managers grow to become highly skilled project professionals to handle complex deliveries.

Senior project managers may have one or more junior project managers working under their supervision. They also coach and mentor the new project managers on the nuances of project delivery.

Senior project managers are also involved in process improvement areas and contribute to strategic planning.

**4) Program managers (PgM):** Govern multiple interrelated projects where the project managers and the senior project managers report to the program manager.

Program managers are responsible for the performance of programs. They oversee the performance of multiple interrelated projects as well as the performance of project managers under them.

**5) Portfolio managers (PfM):** A portfolio manager is in charge of overseeing multiple programs. Portfolio managers oversee the performance of multiple programs as well as operations. They cascade the organizational objectives and strategies to program, projects and operations.

In a project organization, both program managers and operations managers report to the portfolio manager.

Program managers and portfolio managers together form an entity or a governance body called PMO (Project Management Office). This governance body owns the OPA (Organizational Process Assets) repository of an organization. The repository contains various resources such as processes, procedures, policies, templates, documents, knowledge base, articles, and links to different tools or portals, which the project managers and the project team use for project delivery. The PMO is responsible for handling escalations, problem-solving, process improvements and many other project management governance activities.
