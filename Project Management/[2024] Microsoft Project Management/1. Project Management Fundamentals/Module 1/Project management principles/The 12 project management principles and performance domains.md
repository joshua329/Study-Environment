# The 12 project management principles and performance domains

## Introduction

This section will elaborate on each of the 12 principles of project management and performance domains by linking them with various tasks in a project scenario. In this way, you will discover how the principles can be adapted for different project environments across industries.

## Project management principles, performance domains, and tailoring

The project management principles along with performance domains and tailoring form a comprehensive framework that guides successful project execution.

**Project management principles**

There are 12 project management principles: stewardship, teamwork, stakeholders, value, systems thinking, leadership, tailoring, quality, complexity, risk, adaptability and resiliency, and change. These principles are unpacked in this reading.

It's important to note that performance domains and tailoring are applied alongside the project management principles throughout the project lifecycle. These are outlined briefly below as they will be covered in detail in subsequent courses and lessons.

### Performance domains

A performance domain in project management is like a large umbrella that covers different aspects or areas you need to focus on to successfully manage a project. Imagine you're planning a big event. The performance domains would include categories of tasks or responsibilities. They include things like starting the project, making plans, carrying out those plans, keeping an eye on how things are going, and, finally, closing the project when it's done. So, performance domains help project managers organize and handle all important elements of the project to make sure it goes well from start to finish.

### Tailoring

Every project is unique and so are its objectives, requirements, outcomes, and performance. Therefore, every project needs customized selection and adjustment of multiple project factors. The term for this in project management is tailoring. This can include the tailoring of processes, principles, resources, requirements, tools and techniques, delivery methods, and development approaches.

## 1. Stewardship

Stewardship covers ethical conduct, such as integrity, care, trustworthiness, and compliance.  Project managers are required to adopt this principle. It is also expected from the internal project team (within the organization) and external stakeholders (outside the organization), such as vendors, suppliers, and contractors.

Trust, one of the components of stewardship, is the foundation of successful relationships within a project team and with stakeholders. This principle emphasizes the importance of honesty, transparency, and integrity in all project relations. Building and maintaining trust develops a positive project culture, encourages open communication, and contributes to a more resilient team that can navigate challenges effectively.

For example, in a project that involves procurement, the project manager guided by stewardship maintains transparency in the vendor selection process, communicates openly about project risks to clients and top management, and builds trust among stakeholders by delivering commitments and promises.

## 2. Team

Successful projects rely on effective and efficient teamwork. This principle demands creating an environment that encourages collaboration. Project managers should promote a sense of synergy, ensure that roles and responsibilities are clearly defined, and provide the necessary support for the team to work cohesively. Teamwork enhances creativity, problem-solving, and overall project performance.

For example, in a product development project, this principle is demonstrated by a project manager fosters teamwork by creating cross-functional teams, encouraging best practices, fulfilling training needs, resolving conflicts, and establishing a collaborative environment that boosts creativity and develops an optimistic work culture.

## 3. Stakeholders

The principle of stakeholders in project management centers on recognizing and engaging individuals or groups who have an interest or influence in the project. In a construction project, stakeholders may include local communities, environmental groups, and regulatory bodies. The project manager applies this principle by conducting stakeholder analysis, understanding their expectations, and involving them in decision-making.

For instance, incorporating eco-friendly construction practices based on feedback from environmental groups aligns the project with stakeholders' interests. Effectively managing stakeholders ensures their support, reduces conflicts, and contributes to the project's success by considering diverse perspectives and interests.

## 4. Value

The principle of value highlights the importance of aligning project objectives with organizational goals. Projects should not merely deliver outputs but should contribute meaningful value to the organization. This requires a thorough understanding of stakeholder needs and expectations. By concentrating efforts on what truly matters to the organization, project managers can ensure that resources are utilized efficiently and that the project has a positive impact.

A project team developing a new software application can ensure value by focusing on features that directly align with customer needs and preferences, ultimately ensuring that the final deliverable (product or service or result) provides maximum value to the users.

## 5. Systems thinking

The principle of systems thinking enables the project manager and the project team to analyze the individual components of the system and its interconnection with each other.

Systems thinking in project management emphasizes understanding the project, considering the interactions and dependencies between its parts rather than focusing purely on individual components. It involves recognizing the changes or decisions in one part of the project that can have consequences throughout the entire system.

For example, in a manufacturing project, different stages of the project such as design, manufacturing, and marketing may operate independently with its own activities but applying systems thinking involves understanding how decisions made in one area can affect the other.

This principle helps the project managers to anticipate potential issues, identify interdependencies, and ensure that decisions made in one aspect of the project align with and support the overall project goals.

## 6. Leadership

Leadership is a crucial element in project management. Project managers should inspire, motivate, and guide the project team to achieve success. This involves leading by example, providing clear direction, and fostering a collaborative and empowering work environment. Strong leadership encourages team members to give their best efforts, promoting a sense of ownership and accountability.

For example, in a complex construction project, the project manager leads by example, showcasing a strong work ethic, providing clear direction, and inspiring the team to overcome challenges with confidence.

## 7. Tailoring

When you tailor a project, you're adjusting the methods and processes to fit the specific needs and characteristics of that project.

For example, let's say you're organizing a party. The standard plan might include sending invitations, preparing food, and setting up decorations. However, if you realize that your guests have dietary restrictions, you'll tailor the plan by adjusting the menu to accommodate those specific needs. Similarly, in project management, tailoring involves adjusting the project processes and approaches to make sure they're a perfect fit for the unique circumstances of your project.

## 8. Quality

The principle of quality in project management emphasizes delivering outcomes that meet or exceed stakeholder expectations. It involves a commitment to excellence throughout the project lifecycle.

For example, in a software development project, adhering to the quality principle means thoroughly testing the software to identify and address bugs, ensuring the final product is reliable and works as intended. By prioritizing quality, project managers enhance customer satisfaction, reduce the risk of defects, and contribute to the long-term success and reputation of the project and the organization.

## 9. Complexity

The principle of complexity in project management acknowledges that projects exist in diverse and sophisticated environments. It requires project managers to adapt strategies to navigate complexities effectively. For instance, in a large-scale construction project, managing complexity involves considering various factors such as regulatory requirements, weather conditions, and stakeholder interests.

A project manager employing the complexity principle would use flexible methodologies, vigorous risk management, and clear communication to address the details manifest in the project, ensuring successful outcomes despite the challenges posed by the complex and dynamic nature of the construction environment.

## 10. Risk

The principle of risk in project management involves identifying, assessing, and handling potential uncertainties that could impact the project. For instance, in a software development project, the risk principle entails conducting a thorough risk analysis to identify potential issues like software bugs or scope changes. The project manager then develops mitigation strategies, such as implementing thorough testing protocols and maintaining open communication with stakeholders. Effectively applying the risk principle helps anticipate challenges, minimize negative impacts, and enhances the project's resilience to unforeseen events, contributing to overall project success in the face of uncertainties.

## 11. Adaptability and resiliency

The principle of adaptability and resiliency in project management emphasizes the ability to adjust strategies in response to changing circumstances. By embracing adaptability and resiliency, project managers enhance their ability to navigate uncertainties, ultimately contributing to successful project outcomes in dynamic and evolving environments.

In a market research project, this principle involves being flexible in data collection methods. For instance, if unexpected changes in consumer behavior occur during the project, an adaptable approach may involve quickly modifying survey questions or incorporating new data sources. This ensures the project remains relevant and resilient to unforeseen changes, fostering the capacity to pivot strategies effectively.

## 12. Change

Change is inevitable in any project. This principle emphasizes the importance of being adaptable and responsive to changes in project scope, requirements, or other factors. Instead of resisting change, project managers should anticipate it and have mechanisms in place to assess, approve, and implement changes efficiently. Embracing change ensures that the project remains relevant and aligned with evolving stakeholder needs.

For example, in a marketing campaign project, the team is open to adapting the campaign strategy based on real-time feedback from market analytics, allowing them to adjust messaging or targeting to better align with audience preferences.

## Conclusion

Principles, performance domains, and tailoring are precisely applied to projects from initiation to closure in various project environments. Beginning with clear project definition, they emphasize continuous communication, collaboration, and stakeholder engagement. Principles like managing scope, time, and cost ensure project control, while maintaining quality standards and risk management enhance project resilience. Integration, procurement, and human resources principles stress the importance of efficient resource utilization and effective team management. Emphasizing adaptability, the principles acknowledge changes in requirements. Together, these principles and performance domains create a holistic approach, fostering a project management culture that drives success by delivering value, meeting stakeholder expectations, and ensuring project sustainability. This integrated framework provides a roadmap for project managers to navigate complexities and deliver projects with excellence.
