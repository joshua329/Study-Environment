# Additional resources: Introduction to project management and the PMP

## Introduction

Congratulations on completing the first module in this course. Along with a great learning experience, you are spending your time productively in learning more about project management.

## Project management and the PMP

Your knowledge will be assessed in the Project Management Professional (PMP) certification. The [Exam Content Outline](https://www.pmi.org/-/media/pmi/documents/public/pdf/certifications/project-management-professional-exam-outline.pdf) (ECO) for the certification gives you an outline of the various domains, such as people, process, and business environment, across which your project management knowledge will be assessed.

Hopefully, being introduced to how projects come into existence from different sources and the process behind project inception has encouraged your interest in project management.  Exploring the role of a project manager and the associated [competencies of a project manager](https://www.coursera.org/articles/project-management-skills) further may motivate you to go the extra mile to acquire those rewarding skills. Not to mention, exploring the various [career paths](https://www.coursera.org/in/articles/project-manager-career-path) in project management further might offer additional information that boosts your confidence at this entry point.

You covered many fundamental project management concepts, including the principles of project management and Organizational Project Management (OPM). You discovered that each of the [12 principles of project management](https://www.pmi.org/-/media/pmi/documents/public/pdf/pmbok-standards/12-project-management-principles.pdf?v=03749f11-8ff8-4aca-97a6-4af1d49bb1ac) serves as a guideline in directing the project and the project team towards achieving the projectâ€™s purpose, so why not learn more? You may also find it valuable to engage further with [OPM](https://www.pmi.org/pmbok-guide-standards/foundational/organizational-project-management#:~:text=Organizational%20project%20management%20(OPM)%20is,context%2C%20situation%2C%20or%20structure.), which drives efficiency in cascading an organization's strategies throughout the organization by integrating portfolio, program, project, and operations management practices.

## Conclusion

Keep up the dedication to your learning journey, and keep on exploring more on the path of project management!
