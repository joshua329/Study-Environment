# Causal Analysis

We know that correlation does not mean causation. This is an important limitation in data analysis. We should be cautious to believe any studies or headlines claiming that one thing caused another without knowing their research methods. However, we often really want to know why something happened. In these cases, we turn to **causal analysis**. Causal analysis generally relies on carefully designed experiments, but we can sometimes also do causal analysis with observational data.

Experiments that support causal analysis:

- Only change one variable at a time
- Carefully control all other variables
- Are repeated multiple times with the same results

### Causal Analysis with Observational Data

Sometimes we need to establish causation when actual experimentation is impossible. This could be due to a variety of reasons. For example, we might want to know why something happened that we really don't want to repeat, or the necessary experiments may be too difficult, too expensive, or unethical. In such cases, we can sometimes apply causal inference techniques to observational data, but we need to be very careful

Causal inference with observational data requires:

- Advanced techniques to indentify a causal effect
- Meeting very strict conditions
- Appropriate statistical tests
