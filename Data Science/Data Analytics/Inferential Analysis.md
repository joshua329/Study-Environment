# Inferential Analysis

A/B tests are a popular business tool that data scientists use to optimise websites and other online platform. A/B tests are a type of **inferential analysis**. Inferential analysis lets us test a hypothesis on a sample of a population and then extend our conclusions to thre whole population.

Imagine we want to know if a blue or a green button will get more clicks on a website. We hypothesize that the green button will be more successful and we run an A/B test on a sample of people that visit our site. Half the sample sees the blue button (option A) and half see the gree button (option B). At the end of the test, 90% of people that saw the green button clicked it, whereas 60% of the people that saw the blue button clicked it.

Now we need to ask, "if color wasn't related to click rate how likely was a 30% difference just by chance?"
