# The Role of Databases in Data Science

As a data scientist or data analyst, you will likely be solving business problems with data (and therefore databases) regularly. Even if you aren't the person deep into the data, you will have to understand how databases work in order to understand how data is stored. This unit will get you ready for answering busiess questions with the most popular database language (SQL).

## What will SQL Fundamentals cover?

- Manipulating data
- Querying Data
- Aggregating Data
- Working with Multiple tables
- Data Acquisition

## Why did we build this?

Databases are at the core of Data Science and are where most data is stored. Understanding databases is an essential skill for everyone who works with data. 

We decided to introduce you to databases before Python because databases are more foundational to data science and there is a lower barrier to entry. Once you complete this track, you will immediately be able to apply your skills to real data problems and query data to answer questions. 

If you would prefer to get started with Python first, feel free to jump ahead and come back to SQL and databases later. It will be here. Databases have been at the core of data science for decades, they'll be here when you get back
