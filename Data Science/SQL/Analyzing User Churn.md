# Analysing User Churn

Next, Catherine wants to take a look at the churn rate.

A *churn rate* is the percent of subscribers to a monthly service who have canceled. For example, in January, let's say Codecademy has 1,000 customers. In February, 200 learners sign up, and 250 cancel.

The churn rate for february would be:

*cancellations / total subscribers* = *250 / (1000 + 200)* = *20.8%*

Catherine wants to analyse the churn rates for Codecademy for the past few months so she write another SQL query
