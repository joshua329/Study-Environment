# Abstraction
This is one of the ways we deal with complexity, it is the idea of simplying a concept in a problem domain with only essential content. 


**Rule of least astonishment** <br>
it captures the essential attibutes and behaviour for a concept with no surprises and no definitions that fall beyond its scope.
