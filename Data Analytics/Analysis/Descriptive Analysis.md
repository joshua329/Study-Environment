# Descriptive Analysis

**Descriptive analysis** lets us describe, summarize, and visualise data so that patterns can emerge. Sometimes we'll only do a descriptive analysis, but most of the time a descriptive analysis is the first step in our analysis process.

Descriptive analyses include measures of central tendency (e.g. mean, median, mode) and spread (e.g. range, quartiles, variance, standard deviation, distribution), which are referred to as **descriptives** or **summary statistics**.

Typically, data visualisation is also included in descriptive analysis. Descriptive analysis helps us understand our data and decide what steps to take next, but we cannot extend what we learn to other datasets.
