# Explore public datasets

**Open data** helps create a lot of **public datasets** that you can access to make data-driven decisions. Here are some resources you can use to start searching for public datasets on your own:

* The [Google Cloud Public Datasets](https://cloud.google.com/public-datasets "This link takes you to the Google Cloud Public Datasets site.") allow data analysts access to high-demand public datasets, and make it easy to uncover insights in the cloud.
* The [Dataset Search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/ "This link takes you to Google's dataset search engine.") can help you find available datasets online with keyword searches.
* [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets?utm_medium=paid&utm_source=google.com+search&utm_campaign=datasets&gclid=CjwKCAiAt9z-BRBCEiwA_bWv-L6PpACh6RzmrJjQjmNGCCE7kky1FCtc6Jf1qld-4NwDMYL0WsUyxBoCdwAQAvD_BwE "This link takes you to the Kaggle Datasets page where you can explore, analyze, and share data.") has an Open Data search function that can help you find datasets to practice with.
* Finally, [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/public-data "This link takes you to the BigQuery public datasets documentation.") hosts 150+ public datasets you can access and use.
