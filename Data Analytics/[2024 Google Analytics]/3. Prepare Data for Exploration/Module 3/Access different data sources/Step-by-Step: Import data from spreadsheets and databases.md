### Example 1: Use the menu to import a .csv file

Sometimes, you’ll need to import the data from a .csv file into a Google Sheet. A .csv file saves data in a table format. Follow the steps below to bring the data from a .csv file into a new spreadsheet.

**Note:** The .csv file you import will differ from the .csv file the instructor imports in the video.

1. In the menu, select **File** then **Import**. The **Import file window** will pop up.
2. Select **Upload **then** Browse **to select the .csv file to import. For this example, select the** .csv **file you downloaded in the previous section
3. Next select the **Import location**. You can:
   1. Create a new spreadsheet
   2. Insert the .csv data as a new sheet
   3. Replace spreadsheet
   4. Replace current sheet
   5. Append (add) the data to the current spreadsheet
   6. Replace the data starting with a specific cell.
4. Next, select the **Separator type**. Google Sheets defaults to automatically detecting separator, or delimiter, type. To manually set the delimiter type, select the dropdown menu under Separator type and choose the separator.
5. Next, determine if you would like the text to be imported with or without formatting. In the box next to **Convert text to numbers, dates, and formulas**, keep the checkmark if you want text data to be formatted.
6. Select **Import data**. The data in the .csv file will be loaded into your sheet, and you can begin using it.

### Example 2: Download data from the Global Health Observatory

You can download public data from the internet, such as data from the World Health Organization and the Global Health Observatory.

**Note:** The Global Health Observatory’s website has been updated since this video was filmed. Follow these instructions to download the .csv file the instructor uses.

1. Navigate to the [Global Health Observatory workforce statistics database](https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/themes/topics/health-workforce).
2. Scroll to navigate to the **Medical doctors** table.
3. Then, scroll over **EXPORT DATA in .csv format** in the table. Right-click, then select **Save link as...**
4. The .csv file will download to your computer as **data.csv**.

**Note: **If you already have a .csv file named **data.csv**, your computer will add a number to the file name.
