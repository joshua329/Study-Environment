## Example 1: Get started

Enter basic data:

1. Begin with a new spreadsheet.
2. Select cell **A2**.
3. Enter your **first name**.
4. Select cell **B2**.
5. Enter your **last name**.

Adjust the size of rows and columns:

To make the text fit in the rows and columns, adjust their sizes. Use either of the following methods:

1. If your name is longer than the width of the column, **select and drag** the right edge of the corresponding column until it fits.
2. To **wrap text**, select the cells, columns, or rows with text that you want to reformat.
3. Select the **Format **menu.
4. Under **Wrapping**, select **Wrap**.

## Example 2: Add labels

Add labels, or attributes, to help you keep track of the data:

1. Select cell **A1**.
2. Enter **First Name**.
3. Select cell **B1**.
4. Enter **Last Name**.
5. Select cells **A1 **and **B1**. To do this, select a single cell and drag your cursor over to the other cell to include it in the selection.
6. From the toolbar, select the **bold icon**.

## Example 3: Add more attributes and data

Add more attributes and data to your spreadsheet:

1. Select cell **C1 **and enter **Siblings**.
2. Select cell **D1 **and enter **Favorite Color**.
3. Select cell **E1 **and enter **Favorite Dessert**.
4. Select **all three cells** and make them bold by selecting the **bold icon** from the toolbar.
5. Adjust the columns to fit the new text.
6. Enter the corresponding data in cells **C2**, **D2**, and **E2 **(your number of siblings, favorite color, and favorite dessert).
7. Add data about two more people in **rows 3 and 4**. These can be people you know or people you’ve just made up.

## Example 4: Organize your data

One way to organize your data is by sorting it.

1. Select all columns that contain data. There are a few ways to select multiple cells:
   1. To select nonadjacent cells and/or cell ranges, hold the **Command **(Mac) or **Ctrl **(PC) **key **and select the cells.
   2. To select a range of cells, hold the **Shift **key and either drag your cursor over which cells you want to include or use the arrow keys to select a range.
   3. Select a single cell and drag your cursor over the cells you want to include in your selection.
2. Select the **Data **menu.
3. Select **Sort range**, then select **Advanced range sorting options**.
4. In the **Advanced range sorting options **window, select the checkbox for **Data has header row**. Make sure that **A to Z** is selected.
5. Select the **Sort by** drop-down menu, then select **Siblings**.
6. Select **Sort**. This will organize the spreadsheet by the number of siblings, from lowest to highest.

## Example 5: Use a formula

Spreadsheets enable data professionals to analyze data. In this example, the instructor uses a formula to calculate a sum.

1. Select the next empty cell in the **Siblings **column (**C5**).
2. Enter the formula =C2+C3+C4.
3. Press **Enter **on your keyboard to complete the formula.
4. The formula calculates the total number of siblings.
