1. **Presentation skills**

Although gathering and analyzing data is a big part of the job, presenting your findings in a clear and simple way is just as important. You will want to structure your findings in a way that allows your audience to know exactly what conclusions they are supposed to draw.

2. **Collaboration**

As a data analyst, you will be asked to work with lots of teams and stakeholders—sometimes internal or external—and your ability to share ideas, insights, and criticisms will be crucial. It is important that you and your team—which might consist of engineers and researchers—do your best to get the job done.

3. **Communication**

Data analysts must communicate effectively to obtain the data that they need. It is also important that you are able to work and clearly communicate with teams and business leaders in a language that they understand.

4. **Research**

As a data analyst, even if you have all of the data at your disposal, you still need to analyze it and draw crucial insights from it. To analyze the data and draw conclusions, you will need to conduct research to stay in-line with industry trends.

5. **Problem-solving skills**

Problem-solving is a big part of a data analyst’s job, and you will encounter times when there are errors in databases, code, or even the capturing of data. You will have to adapt and think outside the box to find alternative solutions to these problems.

6. **Adaptability**

In the ever-changing world of data, you have to be adaptable and flexible. As a data analyst, you will be working across multiple teams with different levels of needs and knowledge, which requires you to adjust to different teams, knowledge levels, and stakeholders.

7. **Attention to detail**

A single line of incorrect code can throw everything off, so paying attention to detail is critical for a data analyst. When it comes to understanding and reporting findings, it helps if you focus on the details that matter to your audience.

### Adding professional skills to your resume

Here are a few ways that you can add professional skills to your resume:

1. Analyze your previous work experience and find opportunities to insert a professional skill. For example, if you worked in a restaurant, you could emphasize your communication and adaptability skills that you utilized to effectively function during peak hours.
2. Call attention to your problem-solving, presentation, research, and communication skills in previous projects or relevant coursework.
3. Add a mix of professional and technical skills in the skills or summary section of your resume.
