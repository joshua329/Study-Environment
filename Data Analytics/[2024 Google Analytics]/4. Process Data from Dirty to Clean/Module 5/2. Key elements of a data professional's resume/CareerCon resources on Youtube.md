The data analytics industry is always changing and constantly aiming to improve its diversity. Google is proud to support a well-rounded education and a more inclusive environment for all of our learners.

Kaggle's CareerCon resources are for *anyone* interested in a data analyst career.

## What is CareerCon?

Have you ever wanted to get into the mind of a data analyst? Kaggleâ€™s CareerCon is an annual and free digital event whose aim is to help new data analysts land their first job in the field. Recorded sessions from CareerCon offer tons of firsthand knowledge and expert advice from top data analysts and hiring managers through seminars, coding workshops, and resume advice.

Although the resources offered are aimed at data scientists, the principles and guidelines are still similar to what data analysts can expect on their career journey.

### **Important note about CareerCon**

Most likely due to COVID-19, CareerCon 2019 was the last event held. At the time of this writing, there were no publicly available plans for future CareerCon events.
