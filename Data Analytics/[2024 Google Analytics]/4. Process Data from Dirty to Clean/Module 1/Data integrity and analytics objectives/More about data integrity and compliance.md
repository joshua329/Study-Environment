# More about data integrity and compliance

This reading illustrates the importance of data integrity using an example of a global company’s data. Definitions of terms that are relevant to data integrity will be provided at the end.

## Scenario: calendar dates for a global company

Calendar dates are represented in a lot of different short forms. Depending on where you live, a different format might be used.

* In some countries, **12/10/20** (DD/MM/YY) stands for October 12, 2020.
* In other countries, the national standard is YYYY-MM-DD so October 12, 2020 becomes **2020-10-12**.
* In the United States, (MM/DD/YY) is the accepted format so October 12, 2020 is going to be **10/12/20**.

Now, think about what would happen if you were working as a data analyst for a global company and didn’t check date formats. Well, your data integrity would probably be questionable. Any analysis of the data would be inaccurate. Imagine ordering extra inventory for December when it was actually needed in October!

A good analysis depends on the integrity of the data, and data integrity usually depends on using a common format. So it is important to double-check how dates are formatted to make sure what you think is December 10, 2020 isn’t really October 12, 2020, and vice versa.

Here are some other things to watch out for:

* **Data replication compromising data integrity:** Continuing with the example, imagine you ask your international counterparts to verify dates and stick to one format. One analyst copies a large dataset to check the dates. But because of memory issues, only part of the dataset is actually copied. The analyst would be verifying and standardizing incomplete data. That partial dataset would be certified as compliant but the full dataset would still contain dates that weren't verified. Two versions of a dataset can introduce inconsistent results. A final audit of results would be essential to reveal what happened and correct all dates.
* **Data transfer compromising data integrity:** Another analyst checks the dates in a spreadsheet and chooses to import the validated and standardized data back to the database. But suppose the date field from the spreadsheet was incorrectly classified as a text field during the data import (transfer) process. Now some of the dates in the database are stored as text strings. At this point, the data needs to be cleaned to restore its integrity.
* **Data manipulation compromising data integrity:** When checking dates, another analyst notices what appears to be a duplicate record in the database and removes it. But it turns out that the analyst removed a unique record for a company’s subsidiary and not a duplicate record for the company. Your dataset is now missing data and the data must be restored for completeness.

## Conclusion

Fortunately, with a standard date format and compliance by all people and systems that work with the data, data integrity can be maintained. But no matter where your data comes from, always be sure to check that it is valid, complete, and clean before you begin any analysis.

## Reference: Data constraints and examples

As you progress in your data journey, you'll come across many types of data constraints (or criteria that determine validity). The  table below offers definitions and examples of data constraint terms you might come across.
