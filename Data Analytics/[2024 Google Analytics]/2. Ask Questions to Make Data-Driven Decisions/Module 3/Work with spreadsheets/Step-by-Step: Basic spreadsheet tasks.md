# Step-by-Step: Basic spreadsheet tasks

This reading outlines the steps the instructor performs in the next video, [Basic spreadsheet tasks](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ask-questions-make-decisions/lecture/lpuHf/step-by-step-in-spreadsheets). In the video, the instructor explains how to organize a spreadsheet and demonstrates how organizing data helps you understand it more fully.

Keep this step-by-step guide open as you watch the video. It can serve as a helpful reference if you need additional context or clarification while following the video steps. This is not a graded activity, but you can complete these steps to practice the skills demonstrated in the video.

    3.	Widen all columns by clicking and dragging the boundary between **Columns D **and**E**.

## Example 4: Make attributes stand out

Adding formatting to cells that contain attribute labels help the attributes stand out.

1. Select cell **1** to select the entire first row.
2. Select the paint can icon called **Fill color** and choose a color. This will fill the cells in the row with your selected color, making the attributes stand out.
3. Select the **B** icon from the menu bar to bold the labels.

## Example 5: Add a column

If you need to add a new attribute to your spreadsheet, add a new column.

1. Select cell **I1**.
2. From the **Insert **menu, select **Column right **from the menu bar. This inserts a column to the right of **Column I**.

## Example 6: Delete a column

Organize your data by deleting an attribute.

1. Right click cell **J1**.
2. Select **Delete column**. This deletes the column and causes all the other columns to shift to the left.

## Example 7: Add a border

Adding borders helps distinguish cells from one another.

1. Select the cell in the top-left corner of the image, above **1** and to the left of **A**.
2. Select the **Borders **icon from the menu.
