# Software Design and Architecture
### Difference Between Software Design and Software Architecture 
- **Software Design** looks at the lower-level aspects of a system. 
- **Software Architecture** looks at the higher-level aspects of a system.

For a new Software Architect, I need to be able to meet and talk to new poeple, and leverage their understanding and context to make better choices. I also need to work with people who are better than myself. I should also read key resources about code, and learning from my mistakes
