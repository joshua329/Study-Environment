# What is Machine Learning Engineering?

What makes machine learning so ubiquitous today? After all, the practice of collecting and analyzing data isn't new to humans. The answer is quite simple: the advances in hardware and computer technologies are what make machine learning possible.

The more training data we have, the better an algorithm can learn its patterns. However, storing and accessing vast amounts of data requires robust hardware and pipelines. And running a machine learning algorithm requires lots of computing power and an infrastructure that allows for a seamless flow of data between the different steps of the algorithm. Here's where the "engineering" in Machine Learning Engineering comes in.

Machine Learning Engineering concerns itself with designing, building, maintaining and fine-tuning computational systems that can execute sophisticated machine learning algorithms on a large amounts of data
