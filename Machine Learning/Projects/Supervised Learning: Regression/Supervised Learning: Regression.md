# Supervised Learning: Regression

Machine learning can be branched out into the following categories:

- Supervised Learning
- Unsupervised Learning

[Supervised learning](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/machine-learning-supervised-vs-unsupervised) is where the data is labeled and the program learns to predict the output from the input data. For instance, a supervised learning algorithm for credit card fraud detection would take as input a set of recorded transactions. For each transaction, the program would predict if it is fradulent or not.

Supervised learning problems can be further grouped into regression and classification problems

**Regression**

In regression problems, we are trying to predict a continuous-valued output. Examples are:

- What is the housing price in New York?
- What is the value of cryptocurrencies?

## **Classification**

In Classification problems, we are trying to predict a discrete number of values. Examples are:

- is this a picture of a human or a picture of a cyborg?
- Is this eamil spam?
