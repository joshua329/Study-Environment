# Probability

Probability is a branch of mathematics that allows us to quanitfy uncertainity. In our dailt lives, we often use probability to make decisions, even without thinking about it. 

For example, many weather reports give a percent chance that it will rain. If we hear that there is an 80 percent chance of rain, we probably are not going to make many plans outside. However, if there is only a 5 percent chance of rain, we may feel comfortable planning a picnic.

Probability is way to quantify uncertainty. When we flip a fair coin, we say that there is a 50 persecent change (probability 0.5) of it coming up tails. his means that if we flip Infinitely many fair coins, half of them will come up tails. Similarly, when we roll a six-sided die, we say there is a 1 in 6 chance of rolling a five.
