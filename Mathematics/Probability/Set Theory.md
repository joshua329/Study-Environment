# Set Theory
Set theory is a branch of mathematics based around the concept of sets. In simple terms, a set is a collection of things. For example, we can use a set to represent items in a backpack. We might have:

``` 
{ Book, Paper, Folder, Hat, Pen, Snack }
```

Notationally, mathematicians often represent sets with curly braces. Sets also follow two key rules,
1. Each element in a set is distinct.
2. The elements in a set are in no particular order.

Therefore, we can say:
```
{1,2,3,4,5} = {5,3,2,4,1}
```

When defining a set, we often use a capital letter. For example,
``` 
A = {1,2,3,4,5} 
```

Sets can also contain subsets. Set A is a subset of set B if all the elements in A exist within B. For example:

```
A = {1,2,3}
B = {1,2,3,4,5}
```

Here, set A is a subset of B because all elements of A are contained within B.
