# Fileless Malware
Fileless malware is a type of malware that ‘lives off the land’ and uses legitimate tools and the user’s operating system to perform malicious activities like privilege escalation, data collection, and more. It’s incredibly hard to detect and almost always missed by antivirus software.

Unlike a Trojan Horse, fileless malware is not pretending to be legitimate software, it actually is a part of legitimate software. Fileless malware hides itself within the code of legitimate software, often altering existing code to make it malicious.
