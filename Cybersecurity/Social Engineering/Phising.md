# Phishing

All types of phishing rely on social engineering to get a victim to take some action, but there are different methods and targets beyond email, for example:

## **Types of Phising**
1. **Vishing** (from “voice phishing”), which refers to the spam calls in which an attacker claims to be from a victim’s bank or law enforcement and tries to extract information.
2. **Smishing** (from “SMS phishing”) is when an attacker attempts to do the same thing over text message, by sending a malicious link.

Many phishing campaigns send out mass spam emails to individuals and organizations, hoping to catch a victim in a wide net. But sometimes, an attacker has a specific target in mind and sends that target a dedicated, personalized email. This is known as ***Spear Phishing***. If the target is extremely sought after, like the CEO of a company, it is known as ***Whaling***.

## **How Does Phishing Work**

Sometimes phishing attacks are just emails or phone calls that attempt to get a victim to send an attacker money or payment information. Others, such as those that get people to click on links that download malware onto their systems, require more technical finesse.

## **Email Spoofing**
Email spoofing refers to when an attacker falsifies their email headers to make it appear as though the email is coming from someone else. Spoofing is a common component in phishing emails, used in as many as 90% of email fraud attacks.

When you typically send an email, the “from” field is automatically filled out. If my email is john_johnson[@]gmail[.]com, and I send an email to my friend, my friend will see that the email came from my email address. However, you can also send emails with simple scripts (here are instructions for sending an email in Python).

When you write and send an email using a programming script, you can configure the email headers to be whatever you want - meaning that an attacker can put any email as the “sender”

# Detection Techniques

Fortunately, there are ways that we can train both ourselves and our organizations not to fall for phishing!
