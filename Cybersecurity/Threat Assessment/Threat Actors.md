# Threat Actors
Individual Hackers. Hackers are people too, and they have widely varied personalities, motivations, and skill sets. 
There is no single profile that can fit all individual hackers without being incredibly vague. Generally speaking, hackers are categorized into **ethical** (white-hat), **malicious** (black-hat), and **semi-ethical** (gray-hat) depending on the actions they take.

We will look at the following threat Actors:
1. Individual Hackers
2. Human Error
3. Script Kiddies
4. Insider Threats
5. Hacker Groups
6. Hacktivists
7. Competitors
8. Organized Cybercrime
9. Cyber Terrorists
10. State Actors

We won’t discuss **APTs (Advanced Persistent Threats)** as a type of their own: An APT is simply a threat actor that has advanced capabilities and is difficult to dissuade. If it takes 6 months to compromise a target, then they’ll spend 6 months working on it.

## **Human Error**
Protecting against **human error** means designing processes and systems in ways where it is impossible (or at least very difficult) for mistakes to have a serious impact. We see this in Murphy’s Law: *if it’s possible to do something incorrectly, someone will do it incorrectly*. 

Human error has caused data breaches, civil engineering disasters, airplane crashes, industrial accidents, and much, much more. It can be both external and internal and includes any action that can be done by a human. Human error has whatever access has been granted to the human making the error, but very little sophistication.

## **Script Kiddies**
**Script Kiddies** is a term that refers to inexperienced hackers who lack experience, as well as have a low understanding of hacking and the tools used to do it. They make use of already existing hacking tools and scripts, without understanding the underlying vulnerabilities that are being exploited. The word “kiddie”, usually used to refer to a small child, is instead used to represent their lack of sophistication.

## **Insider Threats**
**Insider threats** are threat actors operating within an organization. Insider threats are usually employees but contractors or ex-employees can be considered insider threats too.

Insider threats usually have elevated access and increased knowledge when compared to external threat actors. This can make them more difficult to detect, and it can give them more options for how to attack the organization.

Insider threats are one reason why it’s so important to follow the **principle of least privilege!** Limiting the access insiders have means that a malicious insider will have fewer options available to them, and can do less damage.

One specific type of insider threat is that of **Shadow IT**, which refers to assets that are part of an organization’s network, but aren’t set up or managed by IT AND that IT and Security are not aware of. This can be dangerous since unknown assets on an organization’s network can create attack vectors that the organization is not aware of until it’s too late.

## **Hacker Groups**
**Hacker groups** are, as the name suggests, groups of hackers. This is a very broad term, and it can refer to everything from a group of friends who like tinkering with game consoles to state-sponsored threat groups.

## **Hacktivists**
**Hacktivists** are hackers with an ideology, who strongly believe in a cause and are willing to break the law to further that cause.

Hacktivists are defined by their strong motivation; this motivation means that they can be very difficult to dissuade from a target. If one method doesn’t work, they will just try different approaches until something works.

Hacktivists can have a wide variety of objectives that they aim to achieve via hacking. Defacement, denial of service, and leaking confidential information are all common actions taken by hacktivists.

## **Competitors**
Corporate espionage has existed since at least the 1700s, and the digital era has made it easier than ever for unscrupulous organizations to steal trade secrets or sabotage rivals in order to gain an unfair advantage. **Competitors** have been trying to steal secrets from others for centuries.

## **Organised Cybercrime**
**Organized cybercrime** generally has a single overarching goal: Money. Financial fraud, data theft, extortion, trafficking, and so much more. If you can think of an underhanded way to make money with computers, there’s probably a group of cybercriminals doing it.

Here’s a brief list of some things one group, named **REvil**, did in 2020 and 2021:
1. Stole A terabyte of data from a law firm, then attempted to extort, among others, Madonna and Lady Gaga.
2. Attacked a trust that ran schools in the UK, and held stolen data for ransom, along with student’s coursework.
3. Stole plans for upcoming Apple products and tried to hold them for ransom.
4. Attacked a meatpacking company with ransomware, extorting 11 million dollars in bitcoin.
5. Targeted an energy company with ransomware.
6. Stole documents from a Florida-based military contractor.

## **Cyber Terrorists**
**Cyber Terrorists** seek to use hacking to cause large-scale destruction and harm. In some ways, they can be thought of as extremist hacktivists, who seek to use intimidation and destruction to further their cause.

## **State Actors**
**State actors** are some of the most dangerous types of threat actors. They are often highly sophisticated and work with the support of other governmental organizations. They have large quantities of resources provided to them by their government, allowing them to employ skilled hackers, not only to conduct attacks, but to search for vulnerabilities to develop into cyberweapons.

State actors are also highly motivated, working on behalf of a nation-state. If they decide to target an individual or organization, they have a specific objective in mind and will work very hard to complete that objective while remaining undetected, even in the face of adversity. Failure or detection might cause them to retreat, but likely won’t dissuade them from their objective.

They are examples of **Advanced Persistent Threats (APT)**, and they have advanced capabilities and access to resources and are difficult to dissuade from their objective
