# Vulnerability Scans
A vulnerability scan is an automated scan that searches for vulnerabilities in a network or application. As with many tools, they can be used ethically or maliciously. Vulnerability scanning is a very useful tool for defenders to find potential vulnerabilities within their environment before a threat actor does.

Vulnerability scans are most often used for vulnerability assessments, as opposed to threat hunting or penetration testing. Some types of vulnerability scans can be loud and easily detected, and this can be an important consideration when trying to remain stealthy.

# Types of Vulnerability scans

## **Network vs Application**
The two main types of vulnerability scanning are **Network Vulnerability Scanning** and **Application Vulnerability Scanning**. Network vulnerability scanners are designed to scan hosts on a network, such as computers, smartphones, and networking equipment. Overall, network scanning can be considered a “general-purpose” type of vulnerability scanning.

Application scanning is more specific, designed to search for vulnerabilities within specific applications or types of applications, such as web applications or database software.

## Intrusive vs Non-Intrusive
One important attribute to consider in vulnerability scans is how Intrusive the scan is. Non-Intrusive Scanning (or Passive Scanning) is passive and doesn’t directly interact with its targets, while Intrusive Scanning (or Active Scanning) does actively interact with its targets.

Passive scanning involves things like analyzing network traffic, looking for signs that something is configured incorrectly. This approach is less disruptive than active scanning but provides less information. Passive scanning can be used in situations where stealth is important, such as penetration testing, or by threat actors.

Active scanning involves actively querying the scan targets to obtain information. This approach provides more information than passive scanning, but consumes network resources and can cause malfunctions in the devices it scans. It can also set off security alerts, even when used for legitimate purposes, because of how similar it is to automated attacks.

## **Credentialed vs. non-credentialed**
Network scans can also be Credentialed or Non-Credentialed: A non-credentialed scan has no special access to hosts: It may be able to send, receive, or inspect packets, but it cannot do anything an unprivileged user on the network couldn’t do. A credentialed scan is when the scanner is given extra access, similar to the access an insider would have.

Credentialed scans usually reveal more vulnerabilities, since they have more access, but the vulnerabilities revealed by non-credentialed scans are likely to be more serious since they are accessible even to unprivileged users.

# Processing Reports

## **False Positives and False Negatives**
Vulnerability scanners generate reports of the vulnerabilities they find, but before we discuss how these reports are used, we must discuss False Positives and False Negatives.

A **false positive** is when the scanner says there is a vulnerability, but there actually isn’t a vulnerability. This can waste the time of security personnel trying to fix a vulnerability that simply doesn’t exist.

A **false negative** is when the scanner says there isn’t a vulnerability, but there actually is. This means that even if a scan says it found 0 vulnerabilities, that doesn’t mean there are no vulnerabilities present.

Both these types of errors can cause problems when trying to identify vulnerabilities that need attention. It’s important to properly investigate reported vulnerabilities and verify their existence before we take steps to fix them. One of the easiest ways to do this is a process called log review, where a reported vulnerability is validated by examining relevant system and network logs.

## **CVEs and CVSS**
If you want to scan for vulnerabilities, you need to know what those vulnerabilities are. One way we define and track vulnerabilities is with CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures). CVE is a list of vulnerabilities, with each entry consisting of a unique identifier, a description of the vulnerability, a list of references for more information, and when the entry was added. This allows us to have a list of vulnerabilities, but it doesn’t tell us much about them by itself.

## **Configuration Review**
Vulnerability scanners don’t just look for known exploits, they also look for configuration issues. In a previous article, we discussed how weak configuration can compromise the security of an environment, and can be just as dangerous as directly vulnerable software. This type of scanning usually requires a credentialed scan and requires the scanner to have information about best practices for configuring the software being scanned.
