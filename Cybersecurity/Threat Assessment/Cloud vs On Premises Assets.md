# Cloud-Based vs On Presmises Assets
Both cloud-based and on-prem solutions have pros and cons, and both can be viable solutions from a security perspective. It’s important for organizations to consider the particular security impacts of a given approach, and decide how best to mitigate the approach’s weaknesses, whatever the approach may be.


## **Physical Attacks**
With on-prem solutions, an attacker can be fairly confident that there is a physical server to steal, and where that server is located.

Cloud-based systems don’t necessarily have the same issue. There is a saying “The Cloud is just someone else’s computer”, but the reality is more complicated. Virtual assets may be split among multiple physical computers, and those physical computers may not have a complete copy of the virtual asset.

## **Denial of Service**
DoS attacks on cloud-based assets can be more of a problem than for on-prem assets. If a physical server in the same building as you has been overwhelmed by traffic and needs to be reset, you can walk over to it and restart it. If a cloud-based server is in the same situation, it may not respond to restart commands, making the process more difficult.

On the other hand, many cloud-based hosting providers offer DoS mitigation, which might make DoS attacks less of an issue than for on-prem assets.

## **Larger attack surfers**
Cloud-based assets may have a larger attack surface than on-prem assets. For example, if a cloud service provider is targeted by a threat actor, cloud-based assets hosted by that provider might get caught up in the attacks as well.

## **Trust**
3rd-party vendors aren’t always honest about their services, and it’s not unheard of for cloud service providers to overstate their security. If your organization has excellent security practices, but a cloud service provider you use doesn’t, then the assets you have with that service provider could be at risk.
