# Zero-Day Attacks
A **zero-day** (also called “0-day”) vulnerability is a newly-discovered software bug that a developer was not aware of before the software was released. Therefore, after it is discovered, the developer has “zero” days to patch it before it can be exploited. When a “zero-day attack” occurs, the vulnerability quickly becomes known and is patched by the developer.

## **Finding and Classifying Vulnerabilities**

The vast majority of cyber attacks exploit existing vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities are catalogued and numbered as CVEs, or “Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures” and are maintained in places like the Mitre Corporation’s database or the National Vulnerability Database (NVD).

Thousands of CVEs are recorded every year and are typically found first by either security companies or researchers participating in companies’ bug bounty programs. Bug bounty programs offer money (a bounty) to anyone able to find a vulnerability in their systems. Once the vulnerability is found, the organizations are able to implement a patch and release a software update as soon as possible. It is much more difficult to attack an organization that keeps its software up to date!
