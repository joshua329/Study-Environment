# Third-Party Risk Management
Using third-party tools assists in the operations of a company, but comes with a security risk. The process of measuring that risk and implementing controls to mitigate it is a cybersecurity practice known as **third-party risk management**.

Let’s take a look at some of the most common elements that are involved in the Third-Party Risk Management process:
- Vendor Management
- System Integration
- Supply Chain
- Outsourced Code Development
- Data Storage

## **Vendor Management**
A **vendor** is any company that offers its product or service for sale. Each offering comes with its own benefits and risks.

Vendor risk is the risk that is associated with these offerings and it comes in many different forms. And there are many risks to consider, including:

- **Cyber/Compliance:** This type of risk is related to the security posture and compliance of the vendor. If we purchase a product from a vendor that has security issues, we’ll be poisoning our own environment once the vendor’s product is integrated. Also, adopting a product that isn’t compliant with federal regulations is a recipe for disaster!
- **Reputational:** Imagine that there is a vendor that offers software that your company is interested in. However, you do some research and find out that the company recently had a data breach and was fined millions of dollars for the violation. You decide to avoid purchasing software since the vendor now has a tainted reputation. No one wants to be associated with bad security incidents!
- **Financial:** Any product that a vendor sells will cost money. If we want to integrate a vendor into our environment long-term, we need to make sure we have the budget to pay for it. We also have to take scope creep into account! Scope creep is when we go over budget due to not pacing the project properly. A considerable amount of planning is needed so that we can avoid scope creep.
- **Performance:** No one likes to pay for a product that does not live up to its expectations. In some cases, vendors don’t perform to the standard that they advertised. Also, every vendor must provide some level of technical and administrative support. If the vendor doesn’t support a product, this may cause a performance risk as well.

## **Risk Assessment**
Before we can even purchase a product from a vendor, we have to dive deep into the risks that it can have. That’s where risk assessments come in. We can use risk assessments to identify the dangers associated with the product and whether or not we want to work with those risks.

## **Due Diligence**
When we decide to work with a vendor, it’s important to note that the relationship is a two-way street. We don’t want to spend money on a product that doesn’t live up to our expectations. We also don’t want to run into support issues in case something goes wrong with the product.

It’s a good idea to always measure the performance of the product and see if it’s still worth paying for. Otherwise, we may end up paying for something that can be a complete waste of money.

## **Monitoring**
When purchasing a product from a vendor, we don’t want to just set and forget. We always want to monitor the technology and confirm whether or not it is doing what we need it to do. If the product is taking our information and sending it to an unknown server, we want to be able to detect that instantly and shut it down. Being able to monitor the actions of the tool is important so that we’re able to take the necessary action needed if something goes wrong.

## **Third-Part System Integration**
Many products offered by vendors allow integration into your current environment. For example, if your organization uses GitHub for version control, code scanning tools can integrate with GitHub and access your codebase.

Although tools that allow integrations can be useful, they also come with some risks. Third-Party System Integrations should be closely monitored so that any potential risks are quickly identified and mitigated.

**Data Integration:** When we add our own data into a product, we can call the process a data integration. Data leakage is a potential risk of data integration. It is important to verify if the vendor has policies in place to protect the data of its clients. Otherwise, we may be handing over our valuable data to a company that does not care about us.

**Application Integration:** This is the most common type of integration. Vendors create products that integrate into our existing tools to make workflows more efficient. As long as the flow of data is secure, we can avoid risk during these integrations.

**Storage Integration:** Whenever we need to store a large amount of our valuable data, we can look to cloud storage providers to get that done. However, integrating cloud storage in our environment can come with the risk of data leakage.

# Supply Chain
A form of third-party integration that requires more attention due to its complexity is supply chain integration tools. When it comes to the supply chain, there are a lot of stakeholders involved and things can get a bit tricky. Supply chain products allow us to manage all the moving parts while ensuring that there is visibility along every step of the supply chain process.

Imagine your company has a supply chain issue where it becomes too difficult to manage and track the deliveries of your products. You decide to integrate a supply chain management software in your organization that can help keep a record and manage daily shipments. Think about some of the risks that may be involved in your integration.

Some workers may falsely check off arrivals just so that they can get their work done for the day. A disgruntled employee may even exfiltrate sensitive data and share it with competitors.

## **Outsourced Code Development**
A common trend that has surfaced over the years is outsourcing code development. Companies hire skilled workers from countries where the cost of labor is low. With a lower cost of labor, companies can hire from a larger pool of candidates, which allows them to develop at a much faster pace and launch products more quickly. 

However, we run a potential security risk with outsourced code. We’re entrusting the intellectual property of our company to a foreign team that may not have aligned security practices in place. Moreover, it can become a challenge to monitor and implement security standards.

# Third-Party Data Storage
Ever since cloud technology became popular, many companies rushed to store their data in the cloud. This proved to be a cheaper and easier alternative to having your own data centers. What also became common was the transfer of data from one platform to another. Many companies share data with vendors and this exchange comes with risk. The three main risks associated with third-party data storage are:

- **Compliance:** Every data sharing scenario must have an agreement that both parties should adhere to. These agreements as well as compliance with federal regulations are important for fostering a secure third-party data storage arrangement.

- **Business Continuity:** A disruption with the vendor may cause a disruption in your business operations. It is important to specify things like SLAs so that your business operations are not negatively impacted.

- **Mobile Device Security:** Many companies may have a BYOD policy, also known as “bring your own device.” However, BYOD can be extremely hard to secure. Mobile devices are portable and easy to carry everywhere, but also easy to lose and access if not secured properly.
