# Threat Actors and Their Attributes
There are a huge variety of threat actors out there, ranging from literal children hacking out of curiosity, to state-sponsored groups of professional hackers. Knowing how a threat actor operates and what attributes they have is crucial for creating a viable defense strategy against them.

## **What is a Threat Actor?**
A **Threat Actor** is, simply, an individual or group that poses a threat to security. A threat actor can be a single person, or a whole group of people. So far, we’ve been using terms like “attacker” to refer to any sort of adversary when giving an example, but it’s often more accurate to use “threat actor”, particularly when there isn’t an active attack involved. This is because threat actors do more than just actively attack.

**Threat actors** don’t just represent entities actively seeking to harm security: They can also pose a potential threat to security. This is important to remember because some threat actors are very, very good at what they do. If you wait until you’re under attack to fortify against them, it’ll be far, far too late.

Threat actors can sometimes be referred to as:

- Hackers
- Attackers
- Threat Groups
- Hacker Groups
- Adversaries

# Classification and Attributes

## **Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures**
The NIST Computer Security Research Center (CSRC) uses Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTP) to describe threat actors’ behaviors:
- Tactics are a high-level description of the threat actor’s behavior: How they go about achieving their high-level goals.
- Techniques refer to the tools the threat actor uses in order to accomplish their tactical objective.
- Procedures refer to the specific implementations of techniques the threat actor uses in the process of achieving their objectives.

## **Attributes to Consider**
Threat actors can have a variety of capabilities and motivations, and it’s important to take these attributes into consideration when talking about threat actors. Some important attributes a threat actor can have include:
- Is the threat internal or external? This can matter a lot when it comes to what access and knowledge a threat actor may have.
- How sophisticated is the threat actor, and what capabilities do they have? Are they novice hackers, or a group of professionals? Are they working on their own, or do they have the support of other organizations?
- What resources does the threat actor have, and how many are they able to devote to targeting you? Are they poorly funded and working independently, or state-sponsored with deep pockets?
- What is the threat actor’s goal? Are they in it for the money? Trying to steal sensitive data? There are lots of potential motivations for threat actors.
- How motivated is the threat actor? Are they likely to give up and move on after a couple of failed attempts, or will they persist for as long as it takes to achieve their goal?

## **Threat Vectors**
It’s also good to consider what threat vectors a threat actor might use. Some common threat vectors include:
- Direct access
- Wireless
- Email
- Supply chain
- Social media
- Removable media
- Cloud storage
