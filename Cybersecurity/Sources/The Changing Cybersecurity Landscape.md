# The Ever Changing Cybersecurity Landscape

Cybersecurity is changing and expanding, now faster than ever before. As computers continue to integrate themselves into our everyday lives, both the scope and importance of cybersecurity increase. We have reached a point where the lines between physical defense and digital defense are disappearing. Cyberattacks are now capable of disrupting transport networks, power grids, medical equipment, communications, and more.

Cybersecurity isn’t just a matter of protecting computers anymore: It’s about protecting ourselves and our societies.
