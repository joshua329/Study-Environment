# Intelligence Sources
There are tons of different ways to obtain threat intelligence, of varying quality and quantity. By knowing what tactics, techniques, and procedures are currently popular among threats, you can more effectively prevent attacks, rather than having to respond to them.

# Conventional Sources

## **Threat Intelligence Providers**
For organizations that don’t want to conduct their own primary research, Threat Intelligence Providers are an excellent source of threat intelligence. These are organizations which conduct threat research, and provide their findings to clients, often as feeds that can be used in SIEMs.

## **Vendor Websites**
Vendors will often provide threat intelligence relating to their own products and services for free. For example, if a piece of software is discovered to have a major vulnerability, the software vendor will usually have information about it on their website, once they have been made aware of it.

## **Information Sharing Centers**
Some industries have Information Sharing and Analysis Centers, which are places to share threat intelligence and best practices. These are often specific to a given industry or sector, such as aviation or finance.

## **OSINT**
Open-Source Intelligence can be a good way to get threat intelligence, and some companies make their data publicly available. Lists of known spammers, malware and virus signatures, and more are all publicly available.

# Unconventional Sources
While conventional sources are good for getting prepackaged threat information, there are other places you can look for threat intelligence as well. These are often less cleanly presented than conventional sources, but can have information that hasn’t made it into conventional sources yet.

## **Academic Journals**
Security researchers, especially those in academic or nonprofit organizations, will publish papers in academic journals. These papers can contain information that isn’t widely known yet, about new exploits, techniques, or discoveries.

## **Social Media**
Social media and blogs can be a good source of threat intelligence. Security researchers and other industry professionals will often discuss current events or new research.

## **RFCs**
**Request For Comments (RFC)** are essentially documents that define how the internet works, propose how it should work, or provide important information - including security considerations or best practices.

## **Security Conferences**
Security conferences are gatherings of security professionals, and usually include talks about everything from cybercrime trends to cutting-edge exploitation and vulnerability techniques. These conferences can be a good source of information about developing threats.
