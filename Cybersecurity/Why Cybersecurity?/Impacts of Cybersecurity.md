## Breaches, Exflitration, and Data Loss

The terms **Data Breach**, **Data Exflitration**, and **Data Loss** sound similar, and are often used interchangeably outside of Cybersecurity. Within cybersecurity, there are some important distinctions between the three terms:
- A **Data Breach** is any unauthorised access to data, intentionally or accidentally
- A **Data Exflitration** is any intentional and unauthorised transfer of data to an external source.
- A **Data Loss** is when data becomes unavailable, either temporarily or permanently.

## The Damage Data Breaches Cause
